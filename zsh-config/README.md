# ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH config
I made this so I could use and configure zsh to be cool
Unfortunately, I was unable to get a script to run to completely change shells and themes all in one, so it's split into 3.
` git clone https://github.com/lungless-chest/bash-scripts/tree/main/zsh-config `
Make all 3 scripts executeable using
` chmod +x zshScript<1,2,3>.sh `
Run them in order of 1-3, then you should be good.
I'll also populate this folder with updated versions of my bash scripts to work on zsh.
